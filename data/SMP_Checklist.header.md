## Introduction

It is easy to concentrate on short-term issues when developing research software. Getting publications, collaboration with others and the demands of a daily research routine can all conspire to prevent proper planning for the development of research software. A Software Management Plan can help us to define a set of structures and goals to help us to understand what we are going to write, who it is for, how we will get it to them, how will it help them, and how we will assess whether it has helped them. They also help us to understand what processes, resources and infrastructure we need and how we can use these to meet our own goals, in the short, medium and long term. They also encourage us to think about the future of our software once our project or funding period ends, and what our plans for its long-term sustainability are. This checklist is intended to help researchers write software management plans.
