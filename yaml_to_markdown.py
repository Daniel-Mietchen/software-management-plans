"""
Program to read in a YAML software management plan advice and guidance 
file and print it out in MarkDown.

Each document in the YAML file corresponds to a single section of the
advice and guidance and is structured as follows:

    ---
    section: About your software - a minimal Software Management Plan
    intro:
    - Context
    - More context
    questions:
    - question: A question with sub-questions and guidance?
      consider: 
      - A sub-question?
      - Another sub-question?
      guidance:
      - Some guidance
      -
        - List for guidance   
        - List for guidance   
      - Some more guidance
    - question: A question with no guidance?
      consider: 
      - A sub-question?
      - Another sub-question?
    - question: A question with no sub-questions?
      guidance:
      - Some guidance
      - Some more guidance
    - question: A question with no guidance or sub-questions?

The following constraints are on each field:

* section: 1+ per document.
* intro: 0 or 1 per document. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ members.
* questions: 1 per document.
* question: 1+ per questions.
* consider: 0 or 1 per question. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ members.
* guidance: 0 or 1 per question. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ members.
* Colons, :, in text should be surrounded by text or, for a lead-in
  to a list a ",". Otherwise YAML will interpret it as a delimiter.
  - "Examples include:one, two, three"
  - "Examples include,"

The above renders into MarkDown as follows:

    ## About your software - a minimal Software Management Plan

    Context

    More context

    ### A question with sub-questions and guidance?

    **Questions to consider:**

    * A sub-question?
    * Another sub-question?

    **Guidance:**

    Some guidance

    * List for guidance
    * List for guidance

    Some more guidance

    ### A question with no guidance?

    **Questions to consider:**

    * A sub-question?
    * Another sub-question?

    ### A question with no sub-questions?

    Some guidance

    Some more guidance

    ### A question with no guidance or sub-questions?
