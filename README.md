### Python

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)

* If you already have Python you can skip this step. If you don't have Python then we recommend [Miniconda Python](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
* Either Python 2.7+ or Python 3.6+ can be used.

**Miniconda Python 2.7**

```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda2.sh
bash miniconda2.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda2
```

Set environment and check:

```bash
source $HOME/miniconda2/bin/activate
python -V
```
```
Python 2.7.15 :: Anaconda, Inc.
```

**Miniconda Python 3.6**

```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda3.sh
bash miniconda3.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3
```

Set environment and check:


```bash
source $HOME/miniconda3/bin/activate
python -V
```
```
Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc.
```

### pyyaml

Install [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org/):

* If you have Anaconda Python you can skip this step.

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

### Microsoft TrueType core fonts:

Install Microsoft TrueType core fonts:

```bash
apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
```

### linkchecker

wget https://github.com/linkchecker/linkchecker/archive/v9.4.0.tar.gz
tar -xf v9.4.0.tar.gz 
cd linkchecker-9.4.0/

## Create Markdown checklist

Run:

```bash
make markdown
```

This will process the files in `data/` and create a Markdown checklist in `build/markdown/`.

---

## Create HTML checklist

Run:

```bash
make html
```

This will create a Markdown checklist, as above, then convert this into an HTML checklist in `build/html/`.

---

## Check links

Run:

```bash
make check-links
```

This will display broken links, if any.

If you see an error e.g.

```
Makefile:66: recipe for target 'check-links' failed
make: [check-links] Error 1 (ignored)
```

then this can be ignored (an error code of 1 means that the `linkchecker` program encountered one or more broken links).

A full report is created in `build/link-check.txt`.

**Beware:** Certain links may be identified as broken when they in fact exist. See the Linkchecker FAQ, [Q:I still get an error, but the page is definitely ok](https://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/faq.html).

---

## Create PDF checklist

Run:

```bash
make pdf
```

This will create an HTML checklist, as above, then convert this into a PDF checklist in `build/pdf/`.

**Troubleshooting**

If you see an error like:

```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'Page 2 of 5
  what():  std::bad_alloc
Makefile:57: recipe for target 'build/pdf/<FILENAME>.pdf' failed
make: *** [build/pdf/<FILENAME>.pdf] Aborted (core dumped)
make: *** Deleting file 'build/pdf/<FILENAME>.pdf'
```

then it may be that one or more image files used in the guide are too big and causing `wkhtmltopdf`, which creates PDFs, to run out of memory. Try resizing the images and try again.

---

## Create Word checklist

Run:

```bash
make docx
```

This will create a Markdown checklist, as above, then convert this into a Word checklist in `build/docx/`.
