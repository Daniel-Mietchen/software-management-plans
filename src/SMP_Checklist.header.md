## Use of this checklist

Advice and guidance provided on writing Software Management Plans, particularly that relating to intellectual property, copyright, licensing and patents, is for informational purposes only. It is not, and nor is it intended to be, legal advice. You should not act in any way on the basis of the information without seeking, where necessary, appropriate professional advice concerning your own individual circumstances.

You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of any advice and guidance provided, and assume any risks associated with your use of this advice and guidance.

## Improving our advice and guidance

At present, our advice and guidance is a draft as we are now rolling it out for use and evaluation by researchers. We encourage researchers, funders and other stakeholders to contact us (<http://www.software.ac.uk/about/contact>) with feedback on our software management plan templates, advice and guidance; suggestions to what software management plans should include; how they overlap with data management plans; and, how to promote their uptake.

## Acknowledgements

Our advice and guidance has its origins in an original guide on Writing and using a software management plan (<http://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans>) written by the Neil Chue Hong of The Software Sustainability Institute, with input from Institute staff Rob Baxter, Steve Crouch, Mike Jackson, and Tim Parkinson, and acknowledgement to Kevin Ashley and the Digital Curation Centre for their work on Data Management Plans.

The advice and guidance have evolved in response to feedback from: Mario Antonioletti, Neil Chue Hong, Steve Crouch, Carole Goble, John Robinson, The Software Sustainability Institute; Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute; Robert Davey, The Genome Analysis Centre; Mark Plumbley, Centre for Vision, Speech and signal Processing, University of Surrey; Chris Rawlings, Rothamsted Research.

We also acknowledge the valuable assistance and generosity of the Digital Curation Centre (<http://www.dcc.ac.uk>), particularly Sarah Jones and Marta Ribeiro, in extending DMPonline to support Software Management Plans.
