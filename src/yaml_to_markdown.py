"""
Read in YAML file with software management plan advice and guidance
and print it out in MarkDown.

    Usage: yaml_to_markdown.py [-f 'text' | 'table' | 'checklist' ] file

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
                            Advice format ('text' or 'table' or
                            'checklist')

Each document in the YAML file should correspond to a single section
of advice and guidance and be structured as follows:

    ---
    section: Section name e.g. About your software
    intro:
    - Context
    - Each entry corresponds to a paragraph.
    questions:
    - question: A question.
      consider:
      - A sub-question to consider.
      - Another sub-question to consider.
      guidance:
      - Some guidance.
      - Each entry corresponds to a paragraph.
      -
        - Bulleted list entry within guidance.
        - Bulleted list entry within guidance.
      - Some more guidance.
    - question: A question with no guidance.
      consider:
      - A sub-question to consider.
      - Another sub-question to consider.
    - question: A question with no sub-questions.
      guidance:
      - Some guidance.
      - Each entry corresponds to a paragraph.
    - question: A question with no guidance or sub-questions.

The following constraints hold for each field:

* section: 1
* intro: 0 or 1. If provided then its sequence must have 1+ entries.
* questions: 1
* question: 1+
* consider: 0 or 1 per question. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ entries.
* guidance: 0 or 1 per question. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ entries.
* Colons, :, in text should be surrounded by text or, for a lead-in
  to a list use a ",". Otherwise YAML will interpret the colon as
  its delimiter. As an example:

    - guidance:
      - Examples of this approach include:one, two, three
      - Other examples include,
      -
        - four.
        - five.
