"""
Read in YAML file with software management plan advice and guidance
and print it out in MarkDown.

    usage: python yaml_to_markdown.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-o FORMAT]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FILE, --file FILE  YAML configuration file
      -o FORMAT, --output FORMAT
                            Output format ('text' | 'table' | 'list')

The YAML file must hold a single document. The document must be
structured as follows:

    ---
    sections:
    - section: Section name e.g. About your software
      intro:
      - Context
      - Each entry corresponds to a paragraph.
      questions:
      - question: A question.
        consider:
        - A sub-question to consider.
        - Another sub-question to consider.
        guidance:
        - Some guidance.
        - Each entry corresponds to a paragraph.
         -
          - Bulleted list entry within guidance.
          - Bulleted list entry within guidance.
        - Some more guidance.
      - question: A question with no guidance.
        consider:
        - A sub-question to consider.
        - Another sub-question to consider.
      - question: A question with no sub-questions.
        guidance:
        - Some guidance.
        - Each entry corresponds to a paragraph.
      - question: A question with no guidance or sub-questions.
    - section: Another section name.
      ...

The following constraints hold for each field:

* sections: 1
* section: 0+
* intro: 0 or 1. If provided then its sequence must have 1+ entries.
* questions: 1
* question: 1+
* consider: 0 or 1 per question. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ entries.
* guidance: 0 or 1 per question. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ entries.
* Colons, :, in text should be surrounded by text or, for a lead-in
  to a list use a ",". Otherwise YAML will interpret the colon as
  its delimiter. As an example:

    - guidance:
      - Examples of this approach include:one, two, three
      - Other examples include,
      -
        - four.
        - five.
